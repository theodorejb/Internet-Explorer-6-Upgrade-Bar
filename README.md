Internet Explorer 6 Upgrade Bar
===============================

A flexible upgrade bar for IE6-8 created with HTML and CSS

This upgrade bar looks similar to Microsoft's upgrade bar image from http://www.ie6countdown.com/, but it's much smaller, more flexible, and easy to customize. Feel free to use this code or modify it to suit your needs.
